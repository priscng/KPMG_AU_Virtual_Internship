# KPMG Virtual Internship Program


## Scope
The KPMG AU Data Analytics virtual internship contains three modules:
- Data Quality Assessment : Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis
- Data Insights : Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.
- Data Insights and Presentation : Using visualisations to present insights

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by KPMG and is to be used for KPMG Virtual Internship purposes. The data and information in this document is reflective of a hypothetical situation and client.

## Background of the problem
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes and cycling accessories organisation, needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, and their marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviour

Sprocket Central has provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

- Customer Demographic
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data in the past 3 months

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has also given a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation.

The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analysed, the data would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.

The task is to assess the quality of the data provided, recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation and to provide a visualisation dashboard to highlight the key insights.
